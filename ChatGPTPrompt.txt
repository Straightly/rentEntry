Sure, here's a list of all the prompts you gave to generate the program:

1. Write me an application to do data entry and collect the entries into a list. Each entry will have a date, a string for property, a string for unit, and a number with two decimal places for amount.
2. Write a JavaScript application with React to be hosted in Node. The application will be used to do data entry and collect the entries into a list. Each entry will have a date, a string for property, a string for unit, and a number with two decimal places for amount.
3. Do you know if I initiate an app use npx create-react-app my-app, will it run in node?
4. What is the best IDE for Python?
5. Can you also add a sum of all amount entered at the bottom?
6. After submit, leave the values, except the unit and amount?
7. Can you add a button at the very bottom to allow me to save the list as a .json file? Please add a field to the left of the button for me to enter the file name.
8. Can you add a button on the top to allow me to select a file from my local computer to load a previously saved .json file?
9. Can you move the button to input file to the top, above the entry fields?
10. When you load the file, can you get rid of the loaded entry, but add all the entries to collected entry and also update the total?
11. Got "Line 47:7: 'setTotalAmount' is not defined no-undef"
12. Remove the loaded entries: label and the loaded entry list.
13. You forgot to remove "Line 10:10: 'loadedEntries' is assigned a value but never used no-unused-vars"
14. Can you add a sequence number to the entries of the list, starting at 1 and increment by 1?
15. I would like to add more functions to the app. I am worried, however, the change might mess up the app. Can you remember this version of code as version "beforeEdit" so I can come back to it if I mess up?
16. Can you make all entries selectable? When an entry is selected, populate the fields with the values from the entry. I will then change the values in some of the fields. After that, if I click on submit, instead of adding a new entry, the selected entry will be updated.
17. There was a regression. When I click the submit button (or the update button if a selection was made), I want you to keep all other fields except the unit and amount. But now, they are wiped out.
18. Can you please preserve the other fields except the unit and amount?
19. Can you make the list to be displayed with the field names as the titles for the column? Please also align the numbers by the decimal point.


Now here is something fun.  After you generate the code, you give me a button to copy the code.  That is great.  Can you move that button to the bottom of the code window, so I do not have to scroll up to copy the code, then scroll down again to write prompt?
It proceeded to create some code for me to actually dump the source code :-).  I asked it to forget this last prompt and we will see if it remembered it.



The prompt for changing the property field to a dropdown and fixing any issues afterward is:

Can you change the property field to a dropdown list composed of strings "2604", "ChinaTown", "Marie", "Sacajawea", "Yakima", and "Ruby"? It should continue to allow me to type, which will narrow down the selection to match the letters I typed.

And the one after this?

The prompt after changing the property field to a dropdown and fixing any subsequent issues is:

It did not work. After I made a selection of the dropdown, I can no longer type anything to change the selection. After I made a selection, the dropdown should display the full list if I click the down arrow. It should also start with an empty string to filter.
